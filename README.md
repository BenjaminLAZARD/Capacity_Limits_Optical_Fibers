# SOCOM208
## Find a lower bound of the Capacity Limits of Optic Fiber Networks

**[PLEASE READ THE REPORTS](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4-sjPft_IJGdkE0aklRaFdLQ2s) BEFORE** you dive into the code.

Final Year project. Together with [Vincent Charbonnieras](https://www.facebook.com/vincent.charbonnieras?ref=br_rs), 
we obtained the best grade for this final year project at [Telecom Paristech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng) in the Major Systems and Objects of Communication of course SOCOM208, taught by [Mansoor Yousefi](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/misvand/).

Based on the [paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5420239/?reload=true) of [Ren√© Essiambre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rene-jean-essiambre-075302/)
& al., we tried to find a lower bound of the Capacity of Optical Fiber Networks. 

Unfortunately, we did not finish... But we were almost there.
