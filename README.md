## Find a lower bound of the Capacity Limits of Optic Fiber Networks

Final Year project. Together with [Vincent Charbonnieras](https://www.facebook.com/vincent.charbonnieras?ref=br_rs), 
we obtained the best grade for this final year project at [Telecom Paristech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng) in the Major Systems and Objects of Communication.

Based on the [paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5420239/?reload=true) of [René Essiambre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rene-jean-essiambre-075302/)
& al., we tried to find a lower bound of the Capacity of Optical Fiber Networks. 

Unfortunately, we did not finish... But we were almost there.
